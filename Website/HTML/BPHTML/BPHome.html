            <p>This is where I will be publishing and telling you some things about my class etc. and also about myself and what I like! I have been progressively learning different commands and I really try to get myself out there and advance. I am aware of how much I do not know of HTML and CSS, but so far, I am really enjoying my development with that sort of thing!</p>
            <p>Also, for the ones wondering what in the heck made me learn these things I have applied: I have been using Sololearn to learn things from the bottom-up. However, Sololearn wasn't my main source of info. I have also been using W3Schools to find more useful attributes and commands etc. to further advance. </p>
            <p>Below there will be some links to the places I have learned my thing, along with some good videos teaching you some things of CSS:</p>
