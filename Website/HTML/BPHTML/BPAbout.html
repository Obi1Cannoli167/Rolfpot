        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p class="desc">So yes, this is 4TPIFI of the school Lycée Technique Privé Emile Metz, a luxembourgish school that teaches technical subjects primarily in luxembourgish while also offering english-speaking classes. The creator of this website is located at the top-right corner of the page, looking quite intoxicated indeed (I'm referring myself by the way), isn't that right?</p>
        <p class="desc">So overall the atmosphere is rather funny and lively, devoid of actual bullying and mockery. This is great to see. We're figuratively considered a big fat happy family of friends, known for name-calling eachother and teasing eachother for funsies.</p>
        <p class="desc">So about the lesson, HTSTA, there's a lot to say about this. This class is really fun because you really get to try out all these ways to mark up and style a website. It is about really advancing and getting fluent and experienced in HTML and CSS. HTSTA stands for: HTML Static. So far, for me, it is going really nicely because I learn these two languages really quickly and I pick up dozens of new attributes every time I really get immersed into working with this stuff. Visual Studio Code is what we're all using and it's one of the best for what we have to do.</p>
