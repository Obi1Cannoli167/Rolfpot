                    <p>This is where I will be publishing and telling you some things about my class etc. and also about myself and what I like! I have been progressively learning different commands and I really try to get myself out there and advance. I am aware of how much I do not know of HTML and CSS, but so far, I am really enjoying my development with that sort of thing!</p>
                    <p>Also, for the ones wondering what in the heck made me learn these things I have applied: I have been using Sololearn to learn things from the bottom-up. However, Sololearn wasn't my main source of info. I have also been using W3Schools to find more useful attributes and commands etc. to further advance. </p>
                    <p>Below there will be some links to the places I have learned my thing, along with some good videos teaching you some things of CSS:</p>

        <h2>Oh, and also: we have some meaningless gibberish here below:</h2>
            <p>Other shenanigans crossfit you should message me I'm an enormous man-child. Working on my screenplay heyyy see, I told you skydiving finishing my novel, I'm a nice guy complete lack of shame shooting shooting my hobbies include. P90X lol beekeeping if that paragraph above turned you off living on sailboats that's what she said.</p>
            <p>Snapchat my wife I am currently addicted to I'm fit/healthy and highly intelligent. I'm a big fan of for real though I'm the last of a dying breed someone to provide for you giving massages, very successsful entrepreneur making others feel good let's get weird looking for a third my hobbies include. Is probably a conspiracy on the first date looking for a third I should have grown up in the 40s if you like work hard play hard.</p>
            <p>At least once a day I hope there are good girls left extreme on the first date. Throwing rocks at trains I starred in my own reality show because I am a paradox if you have an innie belly button performance art, you need a real man I starred in my own reality show it's very hard to meet quality women beekeeping throwing rocks at trains. Ages 18 - 22 younger women no robots posing as real people proper grammar or so I've been told I starred in my own reality show.</p>
            <p>Chivalry is not dead making people mad I will love you forever with lots of self-respect. I did a lot of modeling work in the mid-80s if you like my profile if you dress up like a pin-up doll for me if I make fun of you it's because I like you everything destructive that I do, I'm kind of a genius wildly attractive doesn't hurt pics on request is pretty awesome I live in constant amazement of nature and the universe. In my birthday suit there's no such thing as a typical Friday night females ask your mother staying up late if you like.</p>
            <p>I did a lot of modeling work in the mid-80s I will tell you stories forever I know shirtless pics are a no-no, but no crazy chicks. The fact that you are even considering schooling me be my partner in crime full-contact no robots posing as real people that just proves my point, I'm kind of a genius clubbing other shenanigans on the first date clubbing. Clubbing it's huge on my fetish list I may be somewhat jaded keep up with me be my partner in crime.</p>
            <p>Beekeeping I'm really good at I'm an enormous man-child I'm too lazy to keep typing. Are you really going to rule me out becausae of it? that was a joke, by the way I won't bite without permission if you dress up like a pin-up doll for me dive bars, clubbing clubbing living on sailboats bald is sexy there's no such thing as a typical Friday night. It's huge I am a hoarder, but only of top shelf stuff for real though crossfit with lots of self-respect I have an IQ of 140, which means.</p>
