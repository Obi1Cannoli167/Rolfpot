                    <div><p>Hey, everyone. This is me, Rolf Ahrensbach. Now this might not be the most popular opinion, and it might sound very particular, but I am a sucker for Polish cuisine. As I once got a taste of Pierogi, one of the most well-known dishes in Poland, I got hooked, man! It made me crave for more, even if I have many other favorites. I would love to try some more of that pierogi!</p>  
                    <p>Now this dish is usually served with minced meat inside, or with the variant Pierogi Ruskie, which are stuffed with cheese and mashed potatoes inside. My girlfriend said they're her favorite. This made me wanna try them too!</p>
                    <p>If I were to come to Poland again, I would taste every sort of pierogi, because of how amazing they are. They're like super ravioli, because not only are they bigger, they taste way better and don't need anything else to compensate. They might come with a sauce to dip in, but you can enjoy them without!</p></div>
